## What am I doing here?

-	I don't know!
-	I wanted to compare shots side by side locally - I didn't find a readymade solution.
-	So, I made this. Well truthfully, I wrote some requirements and chat made it.
-	I can't take credit - I just told chat what to do and made sure my requirements were met - with quite some iterations.
-	I put it here in case someone else can make use of it.
